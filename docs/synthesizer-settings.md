# List of Synthesizer Settings

- There are two oscillators:
    - One is oscillator A (carrier for frequency modulation)
    - The other is oscillator B (modulator for frequency modulation)
	- Each oscillator has two of sets of settings (one for low modulation and one for high modulation):
		- Frequency (float)
		- Phase shift (float)
		- Warmth (float)
		- Harshness (float)
		- Amplitude (float)
		- Noise level (float)
- There are 4 envelopes:
	- One controls low/high modulation for both oscillators
	- One controls the volume of oscillator A
	- One controls the volume of oscillator B
	- One controls the amount of frequency modulation
	- For each envelope:
		- Length (float)
		- Attack (float)
		- Decay (float)
		- Sustain (float)
		- Release (float)
- There are 2 settings controlling frequency modulation
	- Start frequency modulation amount (float)
	- End frequency modulation amount (float)
